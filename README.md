# Problem
Implementing simple addition

# Scenario
You are tasked with creating an application using WPF and the MVVM design pattern. The application should allow the user to specify two numbers and then add them together.

# Requirements
- Create a WPF application with MVVM architecture.  Do not use an existing MVVM library.
- Create a view with two text boxes to take the values to be added and a read-only text box to display the result.
- The user should click a button to add the two numbers together.
- The button should be disabled if either of the numbers is not specified.
- Ensure proper data binding between the View and ViewModel.

There should be no code in the View.
Write a unit test to cover the addition
